An [art lover](https://rowl1ng.com/blog/art/) and a [computer science enthusiast](https://rowl1ng.com/blog/tech/), both contributing to my passion about using computational intelligence to fuel art creation. This passion further motivates me to investigate how humans perceive the three-dimensional world through artistic abstraction.

I've been exploring the possibilities of 3D sketch-assisted content creation using VR technology and machine learning since joining the [SketchX lab](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2019.
This brand-new research direction is supervised by [Prof. Yi-Zhe Song](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Y.Song/){:target="\_blank"} (Director, SketchX Lab, CVSSP, University of Surrey); co-supervised by [Dr. Yulia Gryaditskaya](https://yulia.gryaditskaya.com), [Prof. Tao Xiang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=MeS5d4gAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Yongxin Yang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=F7PtrL8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="\_blank"}. 

I also enjoy [sharing my knowledge](https://rowl1ng.com/MyWiki/) and [creating videos](https://space.bilibili.com/3556743).
